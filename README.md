# Object Detection with YOLOv5

This project implements an object detection pipeline using **YOLOv5**.  
It allows you to detect objects in images or videos, and outputs both annotated images (with bounding boxes) and detection metadata in JSON format.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Detects multiple object classes using YOLOv5.
- Outputs:
  - Annotated images with bounding boxes.
  - JSON files containing detection details (class, confidence, bounding box coordinates).
- Configurable thresholds for confidence and IoU.
- Easy to extend with new datasets or models.
